# flask_Douban250

This is an exercise on spidering the data from a Duban web page in python and making a visualisation of it.

Thanks to the author for the detailed explanation, which helped me save a lot of time.

The logic of the procedure lies:
（1） crawl the data and save the data in sqlite.
（2） crawl the data with flask framework to analyse and display on the web page.

I will then go on to practice on my own crawling a news site's data and making a visualisation to alert readers to what events appear most frequently in the form of a wordcloud.
